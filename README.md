# SnakesWithAries
Simple snake game made with Python(3.8.5) using the Pygame(2.0.1) library.

Use the .exe file to play the game.
(the .exe file is not working at the moment so please just run the python program to play the game instead!)
Please don't delete any files as it may cause the executable file to stop working!

Hope you enjoy the game :)
